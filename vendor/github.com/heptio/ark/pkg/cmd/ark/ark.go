		Long: `Heptio Ark is a tool for managing disaster recovery, specifically for Kubernetes
cluster resources. It provides a simple, configurable, and operationally robust
way to back up your application state and associated data.

If you're familiar with kubectl, Ark supports a similar model, allowing you to
execute commands such as 'ark get backup' and 'ark create schedule'. The same
operations can also be performed as 'ark backup get' and 'ark schedule create'.`,
